[ ![Codeship Status for fraserxu/xnpm-client](https://www.codeship.io/projects/81275120-0b2b-0132-8282-2227938cc99b/status)](https://www.codeship.io/projects/31923)

The client code to play with the data generated by [xnpm](https://github.com/fraserxu/xnpm).

### Stacks

* [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) - build tool
* [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) - front-end package management
* [reactjs](https://github.com/facebook/react) virtual dom
* [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) data viz
* [shoe](https://github.com/substack/shoe) nodejs socket stream
* [node-bourbon](https://github.com/lacroixdesign/node-bourbon) scss

### Why

I found I could generated some data with [sparkfun](https://data.sparkfun.com) for me to play with, so I made [xnpm](https://github.com/fraserxu/xnpm), a simple script to track the `npm` command history on my computer.

The idea is pretty simple, just a litter **hack** on the **npm** command, send a http get request with `curl` to a specify URL with the command content. Then I could use whatever language I like to play with those data.

Having been played with **angularjs** in 3-4 projects, I decided to try something new. I'm a super fan of **modular front-end development**, so I decide to use **browserify**.

And then the **atom** editor team wrote a blog post about how they use **reactjs** to improve their performance, and I found it's much nature to use it with **browserify** than **angularjs**, as all my code is just some simple component, I could just use the **commonjs** syntax to require it.

And of course, I need to use the awesome **d3** to generate fancy charts.

Last but not least, the data from **sparkfun** could be huge, so I need nodejs stream. And **shoe** from substack could use websockt to send chunk data to the client, and re-render the UI with **reactjs**.

### Result

**Awesome!!**
